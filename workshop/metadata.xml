[h1]NOTE: THIS IS NOT A MOD! SUBSCRIBING TO THIS ISN'T NECESSARY (though it's appreciated)! It's recommended you head to the download page below![/h1]

[h2]Anm2Ed[/h2]

[img]https://files.catbox.moe/3bj6za.png[/img]

A reimplementation of [i]The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth[/i]'s proprietary animation editor. Manipulates the XML-based &quot;.anm2&quot; format, used for in-game tweened animations.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*] Extended version of the original proprietary Nicalis animation editor
[*] Smooth [url=https://github.com/ocornut/imgui]Dear ImGui[/url] interface; docking, dragging and dropping, etc. You might be familiar with it from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3127536138]Repentogon[/url].
[*] New to this editor:
[list]
[*] Can output .webm. .mp4 or *.png sequence (with FFmpeg)
[*] Cutting, copying and pasting frames/animations
[*] Additional wizard options
[*] Robust snapshot (undo/redo) system
[*] Additional hotkeys/shortcuts (rebindable!)
[*] Onionskinning
[*] Settings that will preserve on exit (stored in %APPDATA% on Windows or ~/.local/share on Linux)
[/list]
[/list]

[h3]Note: Difference from Nicalis editor[/h3]
Layers/nulls are handled differently (in their own window) and are not on the timeline! Add a layer/null in the Layers/Nulls window, and then add a LayerAnimation/NullAnimation in the timeline!

[h3]Note on Rendering Animations[/h3]
You will need FFmpeg installed! Get it from [url=https://ffmpeg.org/download.html]here[/url] and point to the downloaded ffmpeg executable within the program!

[h2]Download (Windows)[/h2]
https://github.com/ShweetsStuff/anm2ed/releases
Extract with 7z and run .exe. Check that you have the latest [url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170]Microsoft C++ redistributable[/url] (if you play a lot of games on Steam, you likely will have it).

Alternatively, if you have subscribed to the mod, you can find the latest release inside the &quot;resources&quot; folder. Once downloaded, you can put it wherever you want.

[h3]Happy animating![/h3]
