	[h1]NOTE: THIS IS NOT A MOD! SUBSCRIBING TO THIS ISN'T NECESSARY (though it's appreciated)! It's recommend you head to the download page below![/h1]

	[h2]Anm2Ed[/h2]

	[img]https://shweetz.net/files/projects/anm2ed/screenshot.png[/img]

	A reimplementation of [i]The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth[/i]'s proprietary animation editor. Manipulates the XML-based ".anm2" format, used for in-game tweened animations.

	[h2]Features[/h2]
	[list]
		[*] Extended version of the original proprietary Nicalis animation editor
	    	[*] Smooth [url=https://github.com/ocornut/imgui]Dear ImGui[/url] interface; docking, dragging and dropping, etc. You might be familiar with it from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3127536138]Repentogon[/url].
		[*] New features (from Nicalis editor)
		    [list]
		    [*] Can output .webm or *.png sequence (with FFmpeg)
	            [*] Cutting, copying and pasting frames/animations
		    [*] Additional wizard options
		    [*] Robust snapshot (undo/redo) system
	            [*] Additional hotkeys/shortcuts (rebindable!)
	    	    [*] Onionskinning
		    [*] Settings that will preserve on exit (stored in %APPDATA% on Windows or ~/.local/share on Linux)
		    [/list]
	    [/list]

	[h3]Note: Difference from Nicalis editor[/h3]
	Layers/nulls are handled differently (in their own window) and are not on the timeline! Add a layer/null in the Layers/Nulls window, and then add a LayerAnimation/NullAnimation in the timeline!

	[h3]Note on Rendering Animations[/h3]
	You will need FFmpeg installed! Get it from [url=https://ffmpeg.org/download.html]here[/url] and point to the downloaded ffmpeg executable within the program!

	[h2]Download (Windows)[/h2]
	https://github.com/ShweetsStuff/anm2ed/releases
	    Extract with 7z and run .exe. Check that you have the latest [url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170]Microsoft C++ redistributable[/url] (if you play a lot of games on Steam, you likely will have it).
	Alternatively, if you have subscribed to the mod, you can find the latest release inside the "resources" folder. Once downloaded, you can put it wherever you want.

	[h3]Happy animating![/h3]
